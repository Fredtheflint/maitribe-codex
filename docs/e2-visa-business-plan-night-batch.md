# MaiTribe E-2 Investor Visa Business Plan (Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary
MaiTribe is a holistic AI wellness companion designed for daily emotional regulation, identity-based growth, and practical mental fitness. The company is being built as a US-operating technology business led by founder Frederike Stutt, a German national, under a planned Delaware LLC structure.

MaiTribe combines conversational AI, structured check-ins, identity reinforcement, memory-based personalization, and contextual nudges into one privacy-first product. Unlike therapy platforms, MaiTribe is not a diagnostic tool and not a clinical substitute; it is a daily companion layer between journaling apps, meditation apps, and therapy services.

The E-2 case basis is:
- Substantial committed investment into software productization, operations, marketing, and US market entry.
- A real and operating enterprise with active product development, deployed infrastructure, user base, roadmap, and monetization plan.
- Founder-led management and direct operational control.
- Clear non-marginality through recurring revenue strategy and planned US hiring over 3 years.

MaiTribe monetizes through:
- B2C subscriptions (`Basic` $9.99/month, `Premium` $14.99/month)
- `Connect` premium relationship layer ($19.99/month add-on)
- B2B facilitator licensing (from $49/month to enterprise contracts)

Current traction signals include a 324-person waitlist, live MVP architecture, and an actionable go-to-market plan focused on founder-led content, creator partnerships, and app-distribution channels.

## 2. Company Description
### 2.1 Legal and Ownership Structure
- Planned entity: Delaware LLC (US)
- Ownership: Majority-owned and controlled by founder (E-2 treaty investor)

### 2.4 Core Problem
Users often oscillate between:
- generic wellness apps with low personalization,

This hands-on execution model is suitable for early-stage scale and aligns with E-2 expectations that the investor actively develops and directs the enterprise.

- substantial committed investment,
