# MaiTribe E-2 Executive Summary (One-Pager)

## Company Snapshot
**Company:** MaiTribe (planned Delaware LLC)  
**Founder:** Frederike Stutt (German national)  
**Business Type:** AI-powered wellness technology platform  
**Core Product:** Privacy-first holistic companion app (PWA; app-store expansion planned)

## What MaiTribe Does
MaiTribe helps users regulate daily emotional states, reflect with structure, and build identity-consistent habits. It combines:
- AI companion chat
- Body/Mind/Soul/Energy check-ins
- Identity statements and evidence tracking
- Memory-informed personalized support
- Context-aware reminders and follow-ups

MaiTribe is not a clinical treatment product and does not position itself as therapy. It targets the daily support gap between journaling apps and clinical care.

## Market Opportunity
MaiTribe addresses high-growth demand at the intersection of:
- Mental wellness apps
- Conversational AI companions
- Behavioral consistency and self-development tools

Initial traction includes a 324-user waitlist and an operational MVP with active deployment infrastructure.

## Revenue Model
- **Basic Subscription:** $9.99/month
- **Premium Subscription:** $14.99/month
- **Connect Add-on:** $19.99/month
- **B2B Facilitator Plans:** $49-$149/month + enterprise contracts

Recurring revenue is driven by B2C subscriptions, with B2B serving as a second growth engine.
