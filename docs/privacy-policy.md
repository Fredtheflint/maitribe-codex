## 4. Purposes and Legal Bases (GDPR)
We process personal data for the following purposes:
- **Service delivery** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): account access, app features, subscriptions.
- **AI feature execution** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): generating responses, reflections, and companion messages.
- **Security, fraud prevention, and reliability** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR): protecting users and platform integrity.
- **Legal compliance** (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR): where required by law.
- **Optional sensitive-like profile inputs** such as birth data are processed based on your clear action to provide them and for feature use (Art. 6(1)(a)/(b) GDPR depending on context).

## 5. AI Processing (Google Gemini API)
For AI-powered functionality, relevant user content (for example chat messages, check-in context, and identity text) is sent to **Google Gemini API** for processing.

We do not sell your personal data and we do not share your data for advertising. Data disclosure is limited to service operation needs, specifically:
- **Google Gemini API** (AI inference)
- **Supabase** (hosting/database/auth in EU region)

## 6. Hosting and Storage
MaiTribe is hosted on **Supabase (EU region)**. Core user data is stored in Supabase-managed infrastructure configured for EU hosting.

## 7. International Data Transfers
Because AI processing may involve providers with infrastructure outside your country, data may be processed internationally. Where GDPR applies, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as contractual safeguards) for international transfers.

## 8. Data Retention
We keep data only as long as necessary for service operation, legal obligations, and legitimate business purposes. Retention periods may vary by data type.

If you request deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data unless we must retain specific records for legal compliance.

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:
- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Delete your data
- Restrict or object to processing
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent (where consent is the legal basis)
- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

## 10. Deletion on User Request
You can request deletion of your account and personal data at any time by contacting **privacy@maitribe.com**.

We will process deletion requests within a reasonable period and confirm completion, subject to legal retention obligations.

## 11. Children
MaiTribe is not intended for children under 16 (or higher age where required by local law). We do not knowingly collect children’s personal data.

## 12. Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including access controls, encryption in transit, and secure authentication practices.

No system is 100% secure; if a data incident occurs, we will act according to applicable law.
