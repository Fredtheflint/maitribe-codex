Product: AI Wellness Companion App (PWA)

## Executive Summary

The company projects meaningful growth over three years and plans to create direct U.S. roles in operations, engineering, growth, content, and B2B sales.

## Market Analysis
### Industry Context
The U.S. wellness market is large and growing (applicant targeting a broad market context of approximately **$1.8T wellness economy**). Within this, digital mental wellness and self-care subscriptions continue to expand due to:
- Consumer comfort with digital-first care and coaching tools
- Demand for private, on-demand support
- Growing employer spend on wellbeing and burnout prevention

### Target Segments
1. **B2C Core Users**
- Women and men, 24-45
- Wellness-aware, digitally native
- Looking for daily emotional support, reflection, and personal meaning

2. **B2B Corporate Wellness Buyers**
- Startups and SMBs (20-500 employees)
- HR/People teams seeking low-friction wellness tools
- Companies with distributed teams and burnout prevention goals

### Competitive Landscape
MaiTribe competes with meditation, journaling, and AI chat wellness tools, but differentiates through:
- Holistic framework (Body/Mind/Soul/Spirit), not single-modality
- Identity + behavior loop (reflection -> reminder -> follow-up)
- Optional Astro/Human Design personalization in Premium
- Distinct philosophical foundation inspired by Singer/Tolle/Frankl (non-clinical, practical application)

### Differentiation Statement
MaiTribe is not positioned as therapy or diagnosis. It is positioned as a daily companion for self-awareness and grounded action, integrating emotional support, identity coherence, and personalized rituals in one product experience.
